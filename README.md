# KetaMe

KetaMe is a web application used to find if there are drug interactions in a list of drugs. This can be helpful if you're taking over-the-counter mediciations and don't want any dangerous side effects to happen! It has an autocomplete search for ease of use, and a continuously updating set of data, if new reasearch comes about about the inputted drugs.
